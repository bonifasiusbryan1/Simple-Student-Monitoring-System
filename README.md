## 📋 Overview

This is our **first group project** built with **PHP (Laravel)** and **MySQL**, designed to monitor students’ academic progress and status.  
The system supports **4 main roles**:

| Role          | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| **Student**   | Views academic progress and personal study records. |
| **Advisor**   | Monitors and verifies the progress of assigned students. |
| **Department**| Oversees all students in the department. |
| **Admin**     | Manages system data and user accounts. |

I was responsible for **designing the database schema** and **co-developing the back-end** alongside one teammate.
